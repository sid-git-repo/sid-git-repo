## 💻 Tech I Love Working With

- ☁️ **AWS** – EC2, ECS, Lambda, Route 53
- 🔧 **Terraform** – VPCs, failover, and automation
- 🐍 **Python** – Building and learning with small projects
- 🧪 **CI/CD** – Jenkins, pipelines, Docker
- 🧠 Always curious about **DevOps best practices**

## 📚 Learning Journey

🎯 Currently mastering:
- Python (hands-on with a structured roadmap)
