🌍 Currently working on:

Designing multi-region AWS infrastructures (ECS, Lambda, Route 53 failover)

Building Ansible + Python automation frameworks

Managing Terraform IaC for cloud provisioning and blue/green deployments

Dockerizing and modernizing applications for CI/CD pipelines

✔️ Build pipelines that test, deploy, and rollback gracefully
✔️ Monitor, alert, and recover — automatically
✔️ Focus on consistency, reliability, and zero manual errors

🌱 Learning & Growth

Currently deep-diving into:

Advanced Terraform modules and workspaces

AWS CDK and Lambda functions for health checks

Writing reusable Ansible roles

Python automation for CI/CD

Building DevOps-ready frameworks from scratch
